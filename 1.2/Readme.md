The assignment consists of three main classes: **Atom**, **Molecule**, and **Chloroplast**.

1. The Atom class represents an individual atom with properties like symbol, atomic number, and number of neutrons. It includes methods to calculate mass number and compare atoms based on mass number.
2. The Molecule class represents a molecule composed of atoms. It allows users to create molecules by combining atoms and supports operations like addition of molecules.
3. The Chloroplast class simulates a chloroplast responsible for the photosynthesis process. It can add water and carbon dioxide molecules and trigger photosynthesis when conditions are met.
