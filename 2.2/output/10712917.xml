has internalized stigma within government policies, hinder the proper and
essential dialogue between current preventive policies and the needs of the new

a mild disease, by new gender and sexuality performances, and by the search for
a more critical role in affective and sexual encounters, which includes frequent
use of dating apps and substances. The hierarchy of the delivery of prevention
methods is presented as a proposal for a new policy, prioritizing pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) and addressing the social determinants of the HIV epidemic,
including strategies to mitigate stigma. The importance of the participation of
adolescents and youth in constructing the policy and the need for an
intersectoral response are also reinforced.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="pt"><title>Resumo:</title><p>A Organiza&#xE7;&#xE3;o das Na&#xE7;&#xF5;es Unidas tem destacado a possibilidade de eliminar a

Resumen:
</title><p>Las Naciones Unidas se&#xF1;alan la posibilidad de eliminar la epidemia del VIH como
un problema de salud p&#xFA;blica. Sin embargo, un incremento de la incidencia de
esta enfermedad en adolescentes y j&#xF3;venes muestra una mayor distancia entre la
respuesta al VIH y las especificidades de las nuevas generaciones, lo que puede
extender la epidemia durante un largo periodo. En este contexto, se discute que
la oferta de una canasta universal de m&#xE9;todos preventivos, aunque altamente
efectivos, y que un conservadurismo que interioriz&#xF3; el estigma en las pol&#xED;ticas
gubernamentales hacen inviable un adecuado y necesario di&#xE1;logo entre las
pol&#xED;ticas preventivas actuales y las necesidades de las nuevas generaciones.
Estas generaciones est&#xE1;n marcadas por una representaci&#xF3;n social del sida con
menos gravedad, por nuevas actuaciones de g&#xE9;nero y orientaci&#xF3;n sexual y por la
b&#xFA;squeda de un mayor protagonismo en las interacciones afectivas y sexuales, que
incluye el uso m&#xE1;s frecuente de aplicaciones para encontrar parejas y de
sustancias en la escena sexual. Se presenta como propuesta de una nueva pol&#xED;tica
la priorizaci&#xF3;n de la oferta de m&#xE9;todos preventivos, con la priorizaci&#xF3;n de la
profilaxis preexposici&#xF3;n (PrEP) y la confrontaci&#xF3;n de los determinantes sociales

Tambi&#xE9;n refuerza la importancia de la participaci&#xF3;n de los adolescentes y

      <title>The HIV epidemic in new generations</title>
      <p>The resurgence of the HIV epidemic in the new generations <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> poses a mandatory question: are current prevention policies enough to
reverse this trend? Or will it be necessary to collaboratively build other bases and
strategies with society to face this new scenario?</p>
      <p>Changes in how new generations establish their affective and sexual relationships,
associated with the emergence of more effective preventive methods, point to the
necessary reformulation of policies without forgetting lessons learned over the last
40 years. This need for reformulation may be urgent to seize the timely opportunity
to avoid a higher incidence of infection than in the previous four decades.</p>
      <p>Adolescents and youth have been particularly affected by the HIV epidemic. The Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that 28% of new infections in
the world in 2019 alone occurred in the 15-24-year age group <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. This pattern is similar in Brazil, where 25% of infections were diagnosed
in people aged 15-24 in the 2010s decade <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>Since the 1980s, this increased vulnerability of adolescents has been attributed to
the specificities of this life cycle phase, marked by the beginning of sexual
relations in a context of biological, social, psychological, and structural
transition. It has also been associated with establishing sexual partnership
networks that include stable, casual, and intergenerational relationships, often
associated with increased drug and alcohol consumption <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. These aspects have been worsened by insufficient access to comprehensive
health care <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> and by interactions between social markers of differences, such as sexual
and gender identity, social class, and race <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. These markers are essential to understanding the epidemic because they
determine how HIV risk unevenlly affects different population groups. Socially
vulnerable adolescents and youth, especially LGBTQIA+ and black people, have been
disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic than the general population,
primarily due to a higher burden of violence, prejudice, and stigma since childhood
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. There is an even more significant HIV infection burden on transgender
women, whose recognition has been hindered by wrong classifications, including
epidemiological records of cases classified with cisgender men in the &#x201C;homosexual
relationships&#x201D; transmission category <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, the resurgence of the HIV incidence pattern draws attention to aspects
beyond the specificities of adolescents and youth and their relationship with the
current HIV response. Value and behaviour changes notably mark a new generation
about their sexuality, such as the re-signification of gender binary <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> and the adoption of contemporary sexual and affective arrangements <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>, including information technology for sexual encounters <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> and the use of substances for sex <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. Understanding these aspects is absolutely relevant. They mark, in a more
pronounced way, a change in current standards, through the leading role of new
generations in the search for greater identity recognition and LGBTQIA+ citizenship,
at a time when Brazil is experiencing a period of strengthening policies for social
participation in decisions, social inclusion and reduction of inequalities.</p>
      <p>The first evidence of this generational change is shown in the analysis of the
historical series of AIDS cases in three birth cohorts in Brazil, considering the
first five years of case occurrence in each cohort <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">(Figure 1</xref>). The relative numbers of cases in the generations born
between 1995 and 2000 - who, in principle, began their sexual life after
introduction of antiretrovirals and their beneficial effects - surpass those
recorded in previous generations, such as those born between 1965 and 1970, who
began sexual relations during the emergence of the HIV epidemic and were responsible
for the largest number of cases recorded in the country since the start of the
disease - around 17% of the total. Furthermore, the comparison of generations born
in 1995-2000 with generations born in 1965-1970 and 1980-1985 (the age that started
their sexual relations during the most acute period of the epidemic, when there was
no effective treatment) shows that younger generations have reversed the downward
trend in the number of cases. Thus, if this trend is maintained in the coming years,
the magnitude of the epidemic will be more intense in the future than it was in the
last 40 years.</p>

      <title>Risk compensation and new contexts of affective and sexual relationships</title>
      <p>Changes in epidemic patterns in new generations have often been related to a risk
compensation effect due to the perception of reduced disease severity with the use
of antiretroviral medications to treat HIV infection. These changes would have
contributed to reshaping the social representation of the disease, with the society
no longer living with &#x201C;fatal&#x201D;, &#x201C;dangerous&#x201D;, and highly stigmatizing AIDS that &#x201C;grew
out of control&#x201D; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>Evidence of risk compensation has been reported <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>, pointing to at least two dimensions: the intention (or practice) of not
having protected sexual relations and a lower prioritization of AIDS in health
policies and social mobilization.</p>
      <p>However, if the evidence seems consolidated, risk compensation&#x2019;s actual contribution
to understanding the recent resurgence of the epidemic in the new generations
requires further analysis. Health practice, including HIV-related, has shown that
the fear of getting sick is not enough to encourage social groups to adopt long-term
measures that will significantly restrict their daily life and way of living. Over
time, collective learning on how to live and deal with diseases and their
consequences tends to grow, creating a balance between everyday needs and the risk
of getting sick. This reconnection with &#x201C;normality&#x201D; that arises from a collective
learning process does not necessarily imply an increased risk of disease as long as
the new preventive strategies are adequately safe.</p>
      <p>In the context of HIV, with effects in essential dimensions of life, these lessons
learned mostly through community arrangements resulted in preventive strategies that
ensured a gradual resumption of pleasure, affection, and sex even in the early years
of the epidemic instead of the more restrictive recommendations of abstinence and
reduced number of partners. The repertoires of sexual practices without anal or
vaginal penetration, the use of condoms, and seroadaptive strategies are highlighted
here <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>Thus, after 40 years of the epidemic, we could expect that the most effective
treatments, which have increased the life expectancy of people living with HIV to
levels close to that of the general population, would translate into the search for
a better balance between preventive strategies and different needs to perform gender
and exercise sexuality.</p>
      <p>A reflection is necessary: would preventive strategies highlighting the negative
aspects of HIV treatment be relevant to encourage preventive practices? Experience
indicates the possibility of a more negative than positive effect of this choice
because it emphasizes a partial view of treatment and goes against the virtuous
cycle that can eliminate HIV as a public health problem: diagnosis, treatment, viral
suppression, and reduced HIV mortality and transmission.</p>
      <p>In addition, despite the milder representation of the disease, qualitative studies
showed that adolescents and adults at higher risk are constantly concerned about HIV
infection. This can be observed in adult post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) users, who
reported significant distress while accessing and using this prophylaxis, mainly due
to the fear of being infected and the anticipation of AIDS-related stigma <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. Similar feelings were reported by adult men who have sex with men (MSM)
when searching for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). They highlighted that AIDS- and
sexuality-related stigmas are barriers to seeking care <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>, which turned into relief and increased pleasure as they felt protected with
the prophylaxis <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. Adolescent cisgender MSM and transgender women (TGW) also showed concerns
about not getting infected with HIV due to the negative consequences associated with
AIDS, notably the stigma <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>Understanding the search for balance between daily needs and prevention strategies in
a context where AIDS is perceived with less severity than 40 years ago, may be the
key to understanding the resurge of the epidemic in the new generations. From this
perspective, revisiting the late 1990s and early 2000s can be enlightening <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. During this period, an inflection on the gender binary became more socially
visible, highlighting multiple identities and possibilities between the male and
female domains. This occurred concomitantly with expanding the public space for
LGBTQIA+ issues through reconfiguring social identity movements based on gender and
sexual orientation. The result is a context created in the early decades beginning
of the 2000s, during which the recognition of gender and sexual diversity by the
state and society increased.</p>
      <p>In the HIV response, this process is especially marked by three detachments. The
first is the detachment of the LGBT movement in the field of HIV, which has
rearticulated itself after two decades around new social organizations, with a more
specific agenda to guarantee equal rights to the general population and to implement
policies to reduce sexual orientation-related violence <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. This also marks increased &#x201C;serophobia&#x201D; or &#x201C;HIV-phobia&#x201D; within the gay
movement, somehow mirroring a sense of community. Another critical detachment is
being vocal about the specificities of different gender identities and sexual
orientations that would no longer be covered by a particular &#x201C;gay movement
umbrella&#x201D;. This occurs due to stronger agendas claimed by transgender, lesbian, and
asexual groups, among others, reflecting an increased number of letters to the
acronym &#x201C;LGBT&#x201D; and a greater social visibility of these expressions <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. The third detachment is new forms of social organization and political
practices, different from those identified in traditional nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs). The so-called &#x201C;collectives&#x201D; appear as more fluid and less
institutionalized community expressions that articulate different agendas to respond
to problems and establish new experiences and practices to affirm gender and sexual
identities.</p>
      <p>This entire process is reflected in reconfiguring community living spaces and
LGBTQIA+ social interactions, among other aspects. This movement expands borders and
acquires new formats, with contexts more favorable to pluralities and new affective
and sexual dispositions. New spaces open to the diversity of genders identities and
sexual orientations have emerged in the outskirts of large urban centers, places
previously marked by extreme violence against gays, with their own cultures and
independent of the spaces identified as classic homoerotic spaces that were until
then restricted to central regions <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>The reconfiguration of interaction spaces was also influenced by different factors,
especially the new communication technologies, which drastically changed the format
of sexual and affective dates, and which are now mediated by apps and social
networks <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. These new types of interaction promoted, simplified, and expanded networks
and possibilities for finding partnerships, dissociating partnership interactions
from physical spaces such as squares, streets, and other places where LGBTQIA+
interactions traditionally occurred. These apps are so critical in everyday life
that they have become the primary means of finding sexual partners <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>, with more than 60% of MSM, especially young men, reporting making use of
apps once or more times a day <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>, not only to find a casual partner but also to establish affective
relationships, meet and interact with friends, and obtain different types of
services or products, including commercial sex and psychoactive substances for sex.
Thus, it seems natural to define apps as the &#x201C;new public square&#x201D; for homoerotic
interactions.</p>
      <p>Another aspect leading to essential changes in the context of sexual relations and
HIV infection risk was the increased substance use in the sex scenario to facilitate
interactions, improve the sexual experience, and prolong its duration <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>. Although substance use in sex is not new in LGBTQIA+ environments, it has
changed in recent years with chemsex, which defines long sex parties involving
different partners. This scenario includes &#x201C;new substances&#x201D;, some synthetic and
injectable substances used alone or combined and are highly addictive. The main
substances used in LGBTQIA+ environments are crystal methamphetamine,
gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), mephedrone, and ketamine,
in addition to cocaine, poppers, and marijuana. This increased use of substances in
sex is attributed to internalized stigmas of gender, sexual orientation, and AIDS
and the greater dissemination of dating apps <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>. In these apps, it has been common practice to use emojis to indicate
substance trade and the preference for using them at parties, on dates for two,
and/or in the injectable form. The frequency of use has varied significantly by city
and region, with a literature review <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref> reporting lifetime use ranging from 3-31%. Injectable use was reported by
10% among MSM in Australia, and 16% of MSM had clinical records of complications
associated with injectable substances in England <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>These reconfigured sexual interaction spaces have been associated with an increased
risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI), HIV, and hepatitis. This association
is more evident regarding the use of apps due to the increased number of partners,
unprotected sexual practices, and STIs, especially syphilis, gonorrhea, and
chlamydia <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">

      <p>At this point, it is worth reflecting again: what is the possibility of policies,
strategies, and prevention methods consolidated over the last 40 years to
effectively dialogue with this new context of affective and sexual interactions,
which, in theory, favors practices associated with higher circulation of HIV, STIs,
and hepatitis? We must consider that these policies, strategies, and methods were
built in a scenario perceived as more acceptable for social groups to renounce their
daily practices and experiences to ensure health and life.</p>

      <title>Preventive policies and methods</title>
      <p>The concept of combination prevention emerged globally in the early 2000s and,
despite being relatively controversial, established that greater sustainability and
impact required prevention policies to be based on human rights, scientific
evidence, community belonging, and articulation of biomedical, behavioral, and
structural interventions focused on the needs of people and social groups affected
by the epidemic <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. This concept was supported by the successful experience of countries that
effectively responded to the epidemic, such as Brazil, Thailand, and Uganda.</p>
      <p>Preventive methods based on antiretroviral medications emerged around the 2010s.
However, they were emphasized as biomedical interventions of the combination
prevention strategy. They started to be included in a comprehensive package of
preventive measures based on the available evidence of their efficacy and/or
effectiveness.</p>
      <p>The strength of this novelty and its hypothetical potential to reduce the incidence
of HIV proposed a new preventive policy paradigm, which can be summarized in two
premises: there is a preventive method for each point in the chain of HIV infection
(e.g., PrEP before exposure, condoms during sex, PEP after unprotected sex, and
antiretroviral treatment in case of infection) and a method for each person, which
must be chosen according to their needs and context. This new paradigm has often
been associated with the &#x201C;medicalization&#x201D; of the HIV response, weakening a response
based on human rights and addressing structural aspects.</p>
      <p>Over time, programs and services have focused on delivering a comprehensive package
of preventive methods showed limitations and a tendency for reduced effectiveness.
The first limitation is that a basic package consisting almost exclusively of
evidence produced in clinical trials generates competition between methods requiring
the same structure. This would be fine if the population impact and uptake of these
methods were similar or if they were widely available. A good example is PEP, which
has a high degree of efficacy and low potential to prevent cases <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>31</sup>
</xref>. However, it becomes a priority due to the urgency of initiating its use,
which limits the capacity of services to provide PrEP. This is a priority inversion,
considering that PrEP has a greater degree of reducing incidence.</p>
      <p>Additionally, by equating all methods within a basic package, the new policy reduces
its capacity to break with the mainstream approach based on condom supply. This and
other aspects make it difficult for different actors to understand the more
significant potential of new methods to minimize factors that hinder the use of more
effective preventive methods in daily sexual interactions, such as substance and
alcohol use in the sex scenario, power dynamics for negotiating preventive
strategies, and affectivity in stable relationships. One of the consequences is the
maintenance of a condom culture as the only (or primary) form of prevention and of
reduced knowledge and/or mistrust of other preventive methods, as shown by a
qualitative study with LGBTQIA+ adolescents <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref>. This is a scenario in which the new generations resemble their parents and
grandparents about prevention. However, this is not true for how they perform
gender, sexual orientation, and sexual and affective practices, which disconnects
the current context of sexual relations from the current prevention policies.</p>
      <p>Another aspect is that by focusing prevention on the delivery of methods, a large
part of the responsibility for seeking and using it falls on the individual, who
must exercise their &#x201C;freedom of choice&#x201D; based on information such as effectiveness,
preference, and convenience. It is a kind of transposition of liberalism and its
conception of the individual in health care. According to Foucault <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>33</sup>
</xref>, liberalism lends rationality to the market and all relationships that
permeate society. As a result, different social determinants that condition
preventive practice and the HIV epidemic do not receive due importance. A
significant adverse consequence is that introducing new methods within this context
increases inequities and reduces the chance for populations more affected by the
epidemic to benefit from the innovations promptly.</p>

    <sec>
      <title>An HIV response bringing together &#x201C;new&#x201D; and &#x201C;old&#x201D; prevention</title>
      <p>The accumulated experience and evidence produced in recent years helped overcome the
notion of combination prevention centered on a comprehensive package of methods.
They can also help increase the effectiveness of policies by incorporating a less
severe social representation of AIDS into their design and a leading role of the new
generations in a new context of sexual interaction.</p>
      <p>An essential first step consists of organizing delivery and demand creation
strategies for prevention methods based on parameters that articulate public health
impact and the promotion of human rights and equity. This would necessarily lead to
setting a list of priorities to provide prevention methods, emphasizing those with
the most significant potential to reduce infection incidence while tackling the
needs and daily lives of populations more vulnerable to HIV.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that with these parameters, PrEP would be the priority method, not
only because it is strongly associated with a significant reduction in HIV
incidence, reaching median population coverage rates <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>34</sup>
</xref>, but also because it is the method that best allows separating its
utilization (taking the pill) from the sex encounter and that interferes the least
with sexual interaction and practices, regardless of the context and situation in
which they take place <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>This prioritization implies explaining that PrEP should be the method of choice for
populations more vulnerable to HIV, with other methods being optional for people
with a lower risk of HIV exposure or who do not want, are unable, or fail to use
PrEP. This PrEP prioritization becomes more critical considering that the newly
available schemes, notably the long-term ones, are injectable or are in the form of
vaginal rings, facilitating its use and being more convenient <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>35</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>Daily oral PrEP has been less effective in adolescents than adults due to poorer
adherence and persistence. Different factors may be associated with this, such as
more incredible difficulty in organizing daily use, frequent changes in sexual life,
and structural aspects that hinder regular clinical follow-up. Therefore, strategies
that simplify and make this method fit more efficiently in the daily life of
adolescents can make PrEP more meaningful for this population, including the use of
telehealth, provision of the method in the community, peer-led prescription etc.
<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>36</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>A policy based on the rationale of a hierarchy of methods to be provided may be
considered excessively normative, which disregards the diversity of people and the
right to choose, and can be an excessive medicalization of prevention and/or a
return to the strategy of promoting a single method, disregarding different methods
such as condom use. However, it is not the absence or presence of a hierarchy that
determines the degree of the normativity of a public health policy, but rather the
persistence of an approach that disregards the psychosocial dimensions of sex and
care, neglecting the fight against structural determinants of the epidemic, the
absence of collective policy construction, limited access to all methods, and
restricted information for timely decision-making.</p>
      <p>Moreover, prevention policies must reach the necessary balance between the
hierarchical provision of preventive methods and actions to face social
determinants, the violation of rights, prejudice, and the stigma that restricts the
right and access to prevention. In this sense, evidence has shown that structural
actions and the promotion of human rights can be more effective in reducing the
incidence of HIV than the emphasis on providing methods, however effective they may
be <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>31</sup>
</xref>. These actions would help redefine the original concept of combination
prevention as the structuring basis for policies and prevention access.</p>
      <p>In addition, a successful HIV response, among other aspects, is directly associated
with the degree of societal mobilization and with an intersectoral response <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. This was one of the landmarks of Brazilian politics in the first decades of
the epidemic; however, growing conservatism and lower visibility of AIDS as a public
health problem have, in recent years, restricted the involvement of different
sectors of society and weakened the health-related response to HIV.</p>
      <p>The dispute and tension promoted by conservative sectors and values resulted in a
visible internalized stigma in government policies, reducing the budget of anti-HIV
projects and inhibiting essential actions in the HIV response. In the health field,
for example, the lack of massive federal campaigns and strategies for populations
more affected by the infection has lasted more than 20 years. The last campaign
explicitly directed at MSM was in 2008, at sex workers and TGW in 2013, and at drug
users in 2008 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>37</sup>
</xref>.</p>
      <p>Stigmatization processes should be understood as social and political processes
mediated by power relations and implemented by social actors to legitimize the
status of domination of those in a hegemonic position <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>38</sup>
</xref>. When embedded in public policies, they increase the production and
reproduction of structural inequalities, reinforcing social exclusion in different
contexts. This is the greatest challenge in facing the HIV epidemic and the main
barrier to promoting health in populations more vulnerable to infection.</p>
      <p>Also, in intersectoral response and considering education as one of the most relevant
areas, research by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics (IBGE) from 2009-2015 showed a reduced number of
adolescents who had sex education activities in schools, including access to condoms
and prevention of unwanted pregnancy <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>39</sup>
</xref>. This created a sharp contrast: the existence of more effective preventive
methods coexists with generations that systematically fail to develop skills to deal
with the epidemic and with prevention, perpetuating a greater fragility to control
or eliminate the epidemic as a public health problem for decades. This situation was
worsened by the compulsory closure of schools and teaching interruption during the
COVID-19 pandemic and needs to be understood as part of the programmatic response to
any public policy aimed at adolescents and youth.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect of constructing a policy aimed at adolescents is recognizing
and acting on how adult-adolescent-youth power relations are crystallized in social
practices. By coining the term adult centrism, the sociology of childhood examines
the distribution of power between adults in society. In the words of Fulvia
Rosenberg <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>40</sup>
</xref> (p. 25), &#x201C;<italic>in the adult-centered society, the children are not. They
are becoming. Their individuality ceases to exist. They are potentiality and
promise</italic>&#x201D;. This leads to the question: to what extent are adolescents
and young adults seen for what they &#x201C;will become&#x201D; in everyday educational practices,
in service provision, in the formulation of public policies, and even in sexual
interactions and behavior? We live in an eternal ambiguity which, on the one hand,
presents a strong criticism of the adult-centric perspective to recognize the
specificity of adolescents and youth as rights holders. On the other hand, this
presents a set of practices that restricts the participation and engagement of
adolescents and youth in identifying and building responses to the problems they
experience and, above all, to the future they aspire to achieve. Thus, overcoming
obstacles related to the absence of adolescents and youth in decision-making spaces
will be the turning point to constructing policies to combat HIV that make sense and
can reach good results with this population.</p>
      <p>We are living in a crucial moment in the HIV epidemic. The United Nations has set a
goal of ending HIV as a public health problem by 2030. However, the increased
incidence in adolescents and youth that comes along with generations with less
ability to deal with the epidemic points to a persistent incidence in the coming
years, which will not allow the achievement of this goal <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>41</sup>
</xref>. If country responses choose to eliminate HIV, we have to remember that
these new preventive methods can only be a unique opportunity if they are combined
with a policy that provides the best conditions for comprehensive care and HIV
prevention and that responds to the needs of the new generations. It will be
necessary to definitively break with the notion of AIDS constructed over the last 40
years, both from the point of view of its severity and of the supposed effectiveness
in providing a comprehensive package of preventive methods. At the same time, we
should bear in mind that the successful results achieved regarding the HIV response
so far are the construction of a participatory policy - &#x201C;with&#x201D; young people instead
of &#x201C;about&#x201D; young people - that was based on protecting and promoting human rights
and on reducing vulnerabilities and inequities.</p>
