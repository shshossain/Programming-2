## Multiple Class Interaction - Asynchronous Data Processing

In this assignment, goal is to buid a system consisting of several interacting classes to handle the processing and visualization of temperature anomaly data. The process involves reading data from a CSV file, converting it to JSON, and then consuming this data to generate visualizations. Here we implemented asynchronous data fetching and processing, and use the observer pattern to decouple our classes, ensuring a robust and versatile system.
